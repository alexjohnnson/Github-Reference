  <h1> Create A Website With Github</h1>
  <h3>Github is a site used to put live web pages on the internet. Although it's extremely useful, it can be challenging to figure out how to successfully create your website. I have put together a step-by-step guide on how to quickly and easily get your page on the web.</h3>

<h2>Step One</h2>
<p>To begin, click the "+" in the upper right hand corner. In the drop down menu, select "New Repository".</p>

<h2>Step Two</h2>
<p>Next, create a name for your repository. This should be the title/topic of your website.</p>

<h2>Step Three</h2>
<p>Toward the bottom, select the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README". Then click the green button, "Create repository".</p>

<h2>Step Four</h2>
<p>This is the page of your repository. You can edit it from here. To add your files, select "Upload files" which I circled in red.</p>

<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>In this box, you can drag or select your files and add them to your repository. Either drag your files or select "choose your files".</p>

<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>If you have more than one file, highlight them all (Command+A) and drag them into the box or hit "open".</p>

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>Your files should now be listed below the drag and drop box. Add a title for your upload in the first textbox. I used the same title as my repository name. When you're finished, click the green button, "commit changes".</p>

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>In the top right corner, navigate to settings which I circled in red.</p>

<img src="assets/screenshot10.png" alt="">
<h2>Step 9</h2>
<p>Scroll down until you see "Github Pages". Under source there is a drop down box where "none" is selected. Change the setting so that the first option, "master branch" is selected.</p>

<img src="assets/screenshot11.png" alt="">
<h2>Step 10</h2>
<p>The link to your website is now listed inside of the blue or green box. If it is blue, it means some items are still loading and you should wait a few minutes before the site is complete. If it is green, it means your site is ready to go.</p>
